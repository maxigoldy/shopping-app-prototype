# What is a point click prototype (pcp)
In the early stages, we created this prototype. While it may not be relevant for most users, it was important for documenting my personal progress.
We started with a paper-based concept and then built a clickable prototype from it. This represents an early stage of user experience optimization, based on thinking-aloud tests conducted with the paper prototype.
