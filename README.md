## How to use it as a web app?
### Steps to Turn Website into an App (on iOS 26 or newer)
1. Open Safari: Go to the website you want to add. *(Here it's https://maxigoldy.github.io/shopping-app-prototype/)*
2. Share Menu: Tap the "Share" button (box with upward arrow) at the bottom of the screen.
3. Add to Home Screen: Scroll down and select "Add to Home Screen".
4. Name the App: Rename the shortcut if desired, then tap "Add".
5. Open as App: The icon will appear on your home screen, allowing the site to open in a dedicated, full-screen window.

### Chrome "Add to Home Screen" (using Chrome on Android):

--------------------------

This is our prototype of a shopping list web app.
This prototype was developed as part of our studies at Hochschule Bremen (HSB), in the ISMI degree program, for the HCI module.

This is a prototype only and not a finished product. It's not production ready.

--------------------------

### Missing Features
*(Required to make this a production-ready application)*
- [x] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Integration with voice assistants (Alexa, Siri, etc.)
- [ ] Persistent data storage independent of browser cache (database with user accounts)
- [ ] Integration of Stripe or alternative payment providers
- [ ] Removal of demo-only content from profiles and sample items
- [ ] Expansion of default available items
- [ ] Improved inspiration/discovery section (image-based; possible cooking app API integration)
- [ ] Improved UX (User Experience)

--------------------------

### My Lessions Learned
- Utilized Web Storage (Local Storage) for persistent client-side data storage
- Implemented dynamic, single-page–style UI using JavaScript DOM manipulation without relying on frameworks
- Created a simulated subscription (Pro) system to gate features on the client side
